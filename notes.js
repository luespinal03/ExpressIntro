/* 
	Rules of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
		1. An exchange of information across the internet MUST start with a Request
		2. A single Request MUST be answered with a SINGLE Response
		3. The data sent in HTTP requests is always going to be plain text 
			- Note: If we want to send a JSON object, we need to stringify the object first
			- Note: In order for the browser to render the data, it needs an HTML file to tell the browser how to render the data.
				HTML + CSS will tell the browser the structure of a page and how to make it look
			- Note: When you enter a url into the browser that will ALWAYS be a GET request
		4. There are 4 basic types of HTTP request: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
			- GET is used for fetching data from a server. There cannot be any body payload that goes with it.
			- POST is used to create data on the server. The post request comes with a request body payload.
			- PUT is used to modify data on the server, and acts similarly to the POST request.
			- DELETE is used to delete data from the server.
			- AKA: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
		5. There are 3 ways to send user data to the server
			- Query Params: req.query - Used primarily to modify the request parameters
			- Route Params: req.params - Used primarily to request a specfic resource
			- Body: req.body - Used primarily for sending user data
				- Note: In Postman, in order to send a body payload you need to go to the 'body' request tab, select raw and then JSON
